# About {.unnumbered}

**tidycensus** is an R program that makes collecting, analyzing, and plotting census data dead simple. I have used tidycensus extensively in the past, including for my master's capstone.

Since completing my capstone in August 2021, the creator of tidycensus, Kyle Walker, released a book entitled "[Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R](https://walker-data.com/census-r/index.html)." I am eager to read through this book and learn new things.

This repository is a place to organize my progress as I work through the book. All data analysis for this book will be centered around my hometown, Memphis, TN.
