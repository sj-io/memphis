[["index.html", "Memphis About", " Memphis Sarah Johnson 2021-09-21 About tidycensus is an R program that makes collecting, analyzing, and plotting census data dead simple. I have used tidycensus extensively in the past, including for my master’s capstone. Since completing my capstone in August 2021, the creator of tidycensus, Kyle Walker, released a book entitled “Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R.” I am eager to read through this book and learn new things. This repository is a place to organize my progress as I work through the book. All data analysis for this book will be centered around my hometown, Memphis, TN.

The first Census was conducted in 1790, and population counts were (and still are) used to apportion seats for the House of Representatives. Overtime, the decennial Census expanded to collect data on income, education, language, housing, and more. The Bureau also began collecting data more frequently through new surveys, including the American Community Survey (ACS). Unlike the decennial Census, the ACS does not attempt to precisely count all US residents. Rather, this survey is mailed annually to approximately 3.5 million households, representing ~3% of the US population. The ACS is now the premier source of detailed demographic information for the US. Two ACS datasets are made public each year: the 1-year ACS and the 5-year ACS. 1-Year ACS Covers areas with populations of 65,000+. Contains data from one year; higher margin of error. 5-Year ACS Covers geographies down to the block group level. Moving average of data over a 5-year period; lower margin of error. Due to COVID-related data collection problems, the 2020 1-year ACS data will not be released, replaced by experimental estimates. 1.1.1 Geographies Census data is published for a range of geographies, from the nation as a whole, down to neighborhood-scale census blocks. The hierarchy used by the Census Bureau is shown below.1 References "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
