[["index.html", "Memphis About", " Memphis Sarah Johnson 2021-09-21 About tidycensus is an R program that makes collecting, analyzing, and plotting census data dead simple. I have used tidycensus extensively in the past, including for my master’s capstone. Since completing my capstone in August 2021, the creator of tidycensus, Kyle Walker, released a book entitled “Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R.” I am eager to read through this book and learn new things. This repository is a place to organize my progress as I work through the book. All data analysis for this book will be centered around my hometown, Memphis, TN. "],["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 The US Census", " Chapter 1 Introduction This section will cover the basics of the US Census… 1.1 The US Census The United States Constitution mandates a complete count of the US population be taken every ten years. The first Census was conducted in 1790, and population counts were (and still are) used to apportion seats for the House of Representatives. Overtime, the decennial Census expanded to collect data on income, education, language, housing, and more. The Bureau also began collecting data more frequently through new surveys, including the American Community Survey (ACS). Unlike the decennial Census, the ACS does not attempt to precisely count all US residents. Rather, this survey is mailed annually to approximately 3.5 million households, representing ~3% of the US population. The ACS is now the premier source of detailed demographic information for the US. Two ACS datasets are made public each year: the 1-year ACS and the 5-year ACS. 1-Year ACS Covers areas with populations of 65,000+. Contains data from one year; higher margin of error. 5-Year ACS Covers geographies down to the block group level. Moving average of data over a 5-year period; lower margin of error. Due to COVID-related data collection problems, the 2020 1-year ACS data will not be released, replaced by experimental estimates. 1.1.1 Geographies Census data is published for a range of geographies, from the nation as a whole, down to neighborhood-scale census blocks. The hierarchy used by the Census Bureau is shown below.1 Geographic hierarchy used by US Census Bureau Let’s use Memphis as an example.2 Nation: United States Region: South (Region 3) Division: East South Central (Division 6) State: Tennessee (FIPS Code 47) County: Shelby Place: Memphis Counties are further subdivided into census tracts; tracts into block groups; block groups into blocks. 1.1.2 Accessing Data The simplest way to access Census data is through data.census.gov, where users can enter custom queries and download datasets. Bulk ZIP files are also available on the Bureau’s FTP site. Since 2012, Census data is available to the public through APIs. Datasets are assigned a base web address, such as https://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/sf1 for the 2010 Decennial Census. Users can specify which dataset they need through queries. For example, the query ?get=P001001,NAME&amp;for=county:*&amp;in=state:47 asks to see population data for all counties in Tennessee. This data can be seen here. Many R packages make it easier to interact with the Census API, such as tidycensus. Those who wish to access the Census API through R packages need to request a Census API key, available for free. The basics of R will not be covered in this book. A rundown of R and the abilities to use it for Census data are available in Kyle Walker’s book.
